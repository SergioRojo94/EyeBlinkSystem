# EyeBlinkSystem Python

This code contains a system of different "looks" for 20x4 I2C displays. Using ASCII characters, different modes are displayed by console, such as a normal pair of eyes, a wink and more configurations.

The code makes it easy to create and manage such a system, however it is your responsibility to assign the pins correctly when representing the characters on your I2C display.
